### ⚡ The "Hyperfocus" Zone (About Me)

I have a tendency to hyperfocus on learning new skills, whether they involve computers or not. When I step away from the keyboard, you can find me:

- 🎷 **Playing some instrument** (or trying to).
- 🍺 **Homebrewing** (Chemistry is just hardware debugging for liquids).
- 🏋️ **Weightlifting** (Bug fixing my posture).
- 🥘 **Cooking & Baking** (Currently trying to master the cheesecake).

**🎮 Currently Playing:**
*Valorant*, *Overwatch*, and the classic roguelike *Tales of Maj'Eyal*.
